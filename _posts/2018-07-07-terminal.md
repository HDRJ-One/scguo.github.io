## Rationale
I decided to reflect on my terminal set-up since some have expressed an interest. Also, having recently returned to deving daily in Windows, so throwing down my thoughts now may also help jog the memory of a future me.

Here's what my terminal looks like while editing this post:[^1]

## Shell
I am by no means any shell scripting expert but I still use the command line a lot and I've found that [zsh][zsh] works best for me. I find I rarely need to hop into `bash` and then `exit` back out again. Sure, I'll occasionally use [bash][gnu-bash], but I definitely can't recall the last time I've needed to use [csh][csh].[^2] There's also [fsh][fsh] floating around; it seems popular so I'll probably play with it in the near future.

> ProTip: don't randomly `sudo` [stuff](https://xkcd.com/838/) but you may like `su -`

> > NubTip: if your prompt shows `#` instead of `$` you're "root" AKA you're a superuser AKA in an elevated prompt so *Tread Carefully* If you see `%` you're probably lost and using `csh` ~~, lol~~

I also utilize [Oh My ZSH!][oh-my-zsh!] and touch up my prompt using [spaceship][spaceship].

As for being on Windows, I re-acclimatized to using cmd[^3] and PowerShell, since it's the default integrated terminal for [VSCode][vscode].

### Git
I <3 and use [git][git-scm] *a lot*. I personally prefer the CLI to most GUI's (e.g. `gitk`, `git gui`, SourceTree, etc.). I've created a bunch of [aliases][git-config] that I believe cover standard use-cases and pretty much have feature parity for any git IDE integration, IMHO.

I'll write a post detailing my git flow later, seeing as I've taught many people git command line first.

## Emulators
IDK much about TTY, ANSI escape codes, and all that jazz but this is what's worked for me. I'm also not inclined to deep-dive any further at the moment.

During the day, I currently use [cmder][cmder] as my emulator on Windows. It allows me to hop between bash, PowerShell, and cmd with ease. Sadly, IT policy has excluded me from joining the Windows Insider program and trying out [Windows Subsystem for Linux][WSL].[^4] My old rig is still running Windows 7 and it really struggles to wake from hibernation these days; I fear it's on its last legs ;-;

### Multiplexers
A former colleague once demoed their setup and their use of `tmux` scripts for quickly booting into familiar workflows really stuck out to me. I immediately went and cloned [tmux][tmux] and built it from scratch.[^5] After resolving a bunch of missing GCC flags and linking errors I was able to finally able to run `tmux`. In hindsight, I may have wanted to explore [GNU Screen][gnu-screen] before jumping right to its sucessor `tmux`.

I quickly found myself desiring a better aesthetic and searched for customization and styling options. I found [Oh My Tmux!][oh-my-tmux!] and went about customizing the look/feel to my [taste][.tmux.conf.local].

I regularly have [Tmux Cheat Sheet][tmux-cheat-sheet] open since I'm still learning some of the more advanced parts. Ironically enough, I've learnt some [emacs][emacs] bindings partly due to their ease but mostly through separation of concerns when fat-fingering my meta keys.

### Addendum
I actually try not to use a multiplexer if required because ~~I'm too daft to actually learn all the clipboard buffer shortcuts~~ I enjoy using the native terminals and their own windows. This helps me out so that I'm less tied to the special features and goodness something like [iTerm2][iterm2] provides.

To elaborate, I would rather throw and tile two/four windows using Windows window snap (`winkey + arrow keys`) or use [Slate][slate] to do the same on macOS.[^6] I find not having to juggle three levels of clipboard buffers (i.e. [vim][vim]'s, `tmux`'s, OS's) slightly less cognitively taxing.

One last shot of my other terminal look:[^7]

#### Visual Studio Code

Is really damn fine; Microsoft has been doing great stuff for quite a while now.

I did half of this markdown post in `vim` before giving into the live preview + zen mode (`meta + k, z`) of VSCode:

[^1]: I think it'd be cool to use your ambient light sensor/webcam to detect your surroundings' brightness and automatically apply light or dark theme to your apps
[^2]: probably because I wasn't alive when it was hip
[^3]: what do ppl call the default windows terminal? pls ridicule me in a comment
[^4]: but wait! Steve, Y U NO Cygwin??? Well, tbh, I've never had a good experience with Cygwin and now that I'm fairly comfy in my setup, I doubt I'll ever try out Cygwin -again- for the Nth time. Trying out WSL takes priority!
[^5]: Subsequent installations were done using `brew install tmux` because I somehow overlooked that the first time >_<
[^6]: [try out my keybinds][slate-binds]!
[^7]: TIL you can hot-swap theme on the fly with `Terminal->Shell-> Show Inspector` 
[^8]: [nano][gnu-nano] is adorable
