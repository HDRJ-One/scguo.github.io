So I finally got around to adding a comments section via [Disqus][disqus], and [Google Analytics][ga] to this blog.

### Disqus was a breeze.

I had no trouble hooking up Disqus. All I had to do was create an account and paste their JavaScript code into my `_includes/disqus.html` file which I then embedded using {% raw %}`{% include disqus.html %}`{% endraw %} in my `_layouts/default.html`. I copied the comment toggle idea from [this guy][niceguysmile], so I could use `comments: True` in the YAML post header. To cover all my bases I configured the [Disqus JS variables][dq-js] to help keep everything in tip-top shape:

* `disqus_identifier`: identifies the current page
* `disqus_url`: tells Disqus which comment thread to pull up

### Google Analytics was slick, but perplexing.

I signed in/up with my Google account and copied the JS tracking code into `_includes/ga.html`. Following [GA best practices][ga-best], I put {% raw %}`{% include ga.html %}`{% endraw %} right above my `</head>` tag in `_includes/head.html`. This allows for more potential beacons to be emitted to GA before a user leaves a page.

The one confusing thing—I posit is due to [caching][tpp2]—was in the GA Tracking Info→Tracking Code section. Next to the Tracking ID section there is a "Status" field stating **Tracking Not Installed**. This field includes a "Last checked" line with a corresponding date too, which updates relatively frequently. I had confirmed that the GA code was correctly loaded into `<head>` both locally and on gh-pages so this was disconcerting. [Network activity][tpp1] through Chrome's DevTools said every resource was `200 OK`, but there still was no real-time or audience traffic appearing in the GA "Reporting" tab.

After some more browser voodoo (i.e. doing the [cache-refresh rain dance][tpp3]) I eventually saw some activity in the real-time section. This meant the code was [working][tpp4]. I was still curious about the audience section so I hit up Google Search which led me to this [Stack Overflow post][ga-pls].

_I love it._
