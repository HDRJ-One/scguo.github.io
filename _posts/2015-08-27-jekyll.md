I originally considered reappropriating my github page into a blog, but it became obvious that doing so would not scale easily. So I researched some other solutions (e.g. [Wordpress][wp], [Ghost][ghost], [Medium][medium]), but seeing as I was already using gh-pages I might as well use [Jekyll][jekyll]. I have also started learning Ruby, so setting up Jekyll was killing two birds with one stone :smile:.

I worked with this [apposite guide][gospel] and found the experience pretty quick and painless, hitting only three bumps preventing me from running
{% highlight bash %}
jekyll serve --watch
{% endhighlight %}

in my shell ([Git Bash][win-git] with [MinGW][MinGW] port of *nix tools). Yeah, I was using my [Windows laptop][windows], which happened to have another required dependency: [Python][python].

The first thing I encountered was during

{% highlight bash %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

which complained about re-running with [ruby devkit][devkit], so I followed the quick start. That worked so I happily ran

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new myblog
{% endhighlight %}

which created this blog. I tried to start up the locally hosted server with
{% highlight bash %}
jekyll serve --watch
{% endhighlight %}

but it complained about a [header failure][team-liquid], and then a [hitimes issue][420times]. I diligently followed those steps and then was finally able to navigate to [home sweet home][home]. My site responded to changes in the watched directory without installing the [wdm gem][wdm-stuff], so yay!
