I originally considered reappropriating my Github page into a blog, but it became obvious that doing so would not scale easily. So I researched some other solutions (e.g. [Wordpress][wp], [Ghost][ghost], [Medium][medium]), but seeing as I was already using gh-pages I might as well use [Jekyll][jekyll]. Plus, I am learning [Ruby][ruby], so setting up Jekyll was like killing two birds with one stone :).[^1]

I worked with this [apposite guide][gospel] and found the experience pretty quick and painless, hitting only three bumps preventing me from running `jekyll serve --watch` in my shell ([Git Bash][win-git] with [MinGW][MinGW] port of *nix tools). Yeah, I was using my [Windows 7][windows] laptop, but it happened to have another required dependency: [Python][python].

After installing Ruby 2.2.2 with [RubyInstaller][windowspls], the first hitch I encountered was during `bundle install` which complained about re-running with [Ruby DevKit][devkit], so I followed DevKit's quick start instructions. There was a note from `html-pipeline` about bundling Filter gem dependencies, but after a [quick search][so] that appeared to be benign. Since everything else seemed to be in order, I happily ran `jekyll new myblog` which created this blog (I have since restructured the repository). I then tried to start up Jekyll locally with `jekyll serve --watch` but it complained about a [liquid header exception][team-liquid], and then a [hitimes versioning issue][420times]. I diligently followed those two steps and was finally able to navigate to [home sweet home][home]. My site also responded to changes in the watched directories without requiring the [wdm gem][wdm-stuff], so yay!
