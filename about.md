Hi!

I'm Steve Guo and I do webdev. I have had the pleasure of completing co-op placements at [pymetrics][py], [Martello Technologies][martello], [TekSavvy][tsi], and [EPAM][epam]. I also have a B.C.S. from [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca/).

When I'm not [typeracing][typestart] you may find me [taking photographs][flickr], [missing flickshots][ql], biking the [Trans Canada Trail][trail], acrylic painting, or erratically using Oxford commas! I also used to enjoy critting kids as [top][3la] [lane][lecarre] [Tryndamere][suchbot].

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), vi, [Bower][bower], [Bootstrap][bootstrap], [Sass][sass] and narcissism. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/scguo/scguo.github.io).
