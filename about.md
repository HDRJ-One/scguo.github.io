Hi!

I'm Steve Guo, currently studying Computer Science at [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca/). When I'm not prodding a keyboard you can find me critting stuff as [top][3la] [lane][lecarre] [Tryndamere][suchbot], biking the [Trans Canada Trail][trail], or playing ultimate.

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), and narcissism. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/scguo/scguo.github.io).

Non-binding legalese: This is a personal blog so please exercise your discretion here, and note that the views expressed herein are my own and do not reflect those of any other entity. Regarding disclosure, I aim to avoid conflicts of interest, and I may also retroactively fix errors that I am alerted to.
