Hi! `o/`

![Exhibit 1: Steve Guo @ Britannia Beach]({{ "/assets/img/707.png" | absolute_url }})
> `$ whoami`

I'm Steve Guo and I primarily do webdev<!-- and dabble in any and everything -->. I have had the pleasure of completing co-op placements at [pymetrics][py], [Martello Technologies][martello], [TekSavvy][tsi], and [EPAM][epam]. I also have a B.C.S. from [Carleton University](http://carleton.ca/).

If I'm not [taking photographs][flickr] you may find me [biking on the Trans Canada Trail][trail], attempting Ottawa river crossings in flip-flops, failing to impart running English with my 19oz cue, [typeracing as a QWERTY pleb][typestart], [missing flickshots][ql], painting with acrylics, or erratically using Oxford commas! In a past life I also used to enjoy [critting][3la] [kids as][lecarre] [Tryndamere][suchbot].

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), [VSCode][vs-code], [vi][vi], [Bower][bower], [Bootstrap][bootstrap], [Sass][sass] and narcissism. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/scguo/scguo.github.io).
